## Overview

The Mobotix IP Camera Orchestrator extension remotely manages TLS certificates on Mobotix IP Network Cameras (x7 and x8 models). 

This extension provides functionality to:
- Inventory the TLS certificate used by the camera's web server
- Enroll and install a new TLS certificate for use by the camera's web server

Since Mobotix cameras do not support on-device key generation, the extension performs certificate enrollment by:
1. Generating a private key pair in memory on the orchestrator server
2. Creating and submitting a CSR to Command
3. Receiving the issued certificate
4. Uploading the private key and certificate to the camera via REST API
5. Rebooting the device to apply the new certificate

This workflow is fully automated. 

### Use Cases

#### Supported

1. Inventory of TLS certificate (web server only)
2. Automated enrollment and installation of TLS certificates

#### Not Supported

1. Upload of certificates outside the enrollment workflow
2. Removal of certificates from the camera
3. Management (add/remove) of CA certificates on the device

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 25.4 and later.

## Support

The Mobotix IP Camera Universal Orchestrator extension is supported by Keyfactor. If you require support for any issues or have feature request, please open a support ticket by either contacting your Keyfactor representative or via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com.

> If you want to contribute bug fixes or additional enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the Mobotix IP Camera Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.

1. A Mobotix IP Network Camera (tested on MX-V7.3.5.35)
2. An account with **Administrator** privileges
3. Network connectivity from orchestrator to camera over HTTP/HTTPS

## MobotixIPCamera Certificate Store Type

To use the Mobotix IP Camera Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the MobotixIPCamera Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.

The Mobotix IP Camera certificate store type represents the TLS configuration of a Mobotix IP network camera, including
the certificate and private key used by the camera's web server.

Only a single TLS certificate can be active on the camera at any time.
Updating the certificate replaces the existing one.
The default certificate installed on the camera is the factory device ID certificate.

#### Mobotix IP Camera Requirements

1. A user Account with \'Administrator\' privileges (Basic Authentication)
2. Camera IP address (and possible port number)


> [!NOTE]
> As of Keyfactor Command v25.4, SANs can be provided for a Reenrollment (ODKG) job.
> You must also have installed, at minimum, the Keyfactor Universal Orchestator v25.1
> in order for the SANs to be sent to the orchestrator.
>
> The Mobotix API supports only DNS and IP SANs. Other SAN types will be ignored

#### Supported Operations

| Operation    | Is Supported |
|--------------|--------------|
| Add          | 🔲 Unchecked |
| Remove       | 🔲 Unchecked |
| Discovery    | 🔲 Unchecked |
| Reenrollment | ✅ Checked |
| Create       | 🔲 Unchecked |

#### Store Type Creation

##### Using kfutil:
`kfutil` is a custom CLI for the Keyfactor Command API and can be used to create certificate store types.
For more information on [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil) check out the [docs](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)

   <details><summary>Click to expand MobotixIPCamera kfutil details</summary>

   ##### Using online definition from GitHub:
   This will reach out to GitHub and pull the latest store-type definition
   ```shell
   # Mobotix IP Camera
   kfutil store-types create MobotixIPCamera
   ```

   ##### Offline creation using integration-manifest file:
   If required, it is possible to create store types from the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) included in this repo.
   You would first download the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) and then run the following command
   in your offline environment.
   ```shell
   kfutil store-types create --from-file integration-manifest.json
   ```
   </details>

#### Manual Creation
Below are instructions on how to create the MobotixIPCamera store type manually in
the Keyfactor Command Portal

   <details><summary>Click to expand manual MobotixIPCamera details</summary>

   Create a store type called `MobotixIPCamera` with the attributes in the tables below:

   ##### Basic Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Mobotix IP Camera | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
   | Short Name | MobotixIPCamera | Short display name for the store type |
   | Capability | MobotixIPCamera | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
   | Supports Add | 🔲 Unchecked | Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
   | Supports Remove | 🔲 Unchecked | Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
   | Supports Discovery | 🔲 Unchecked | Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
   | Supports Reenrollment | ✅ Checked | Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
   | Supports Create | 🔲 Unchecked | Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
   | Needs Server | ✅ Checked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
   | Blueprint Allowed | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
   | Uses PowerShell | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
   | Requires Store Password | 🔲 Unchecked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
   | Supports Entry Password | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

   The Basic tab should look like this:

   ![MobotixIPCamera Basic Tab](docsource/images/MobotixIPCamera-basic-store-type-dialog.svg)

   ##### Advanced Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
   | Private Key Handling | Forbidden | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. |
   | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

   The Advanced tab should look like this:

   ![MobotixIPCamera Advanced Tab](docsource/images/MobotixIPCamera-advanced-store-type-dialog.svg)

   > For Keyfactor **Command versions 24.4 and later**, a Certificate Format dropdown is available with PFX and PEM options. Ensure that **PFX** is selected, as this determines the format of new and renewed certificates sent to the Orchestrator during a Management job. Currently, all Keyfactor-supported Orchestrator extensions support only PFX.

   ##### Custom Fields Tab
   Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

   | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
   | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
   | ServerUsername | Server Username | Enter the username of the configured "service" user on the camera | Secret |  | ✅ Checked |
   | ServerPassword | Server Password | Enter the password of the configured "service" user on the camera | Secret |  | ✅ Checked |
   | ServerUseSsl | Use SSL | Select True or False depending on if SSL (HTTPS) should be used to communicate with the camera. This should always be "True" | Bool | true | ✅ Checked |

   The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

   ![MobotixIPCamera Custom Fields Tab](docsource/images/MobotixIPCamera-custom-fields-store-type-dialog.svg)

   ###### Server Username
   Enter the username of the configured "service" user on the camera


   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This field is created by the `Needs Server` on the Basic tab, do not create this field manually.


   ###### Server Password
   Enter the password of the configured "service" user on the camera


   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > This field is created by the `Needs Server` on the Basic tab, do not create this field manually.


   ###### Use SSL
   Select True or False depending on if SSL (HTTPS) should be used to communicate with the camera. This should always be "True"

## Certificate Behavior and Constraints

Due to device limitations:

- Only a single TLS certificate is managed per device
- Certificate and private key are uploaded separately
- A **device reboot is required** for the certificate to take effect (handled automatically via the enrollment workflow)

## Caveats

> [!NOTE]
> **v1.0.0**
> - Only one certificate is managed at a time
> - ODKG/Reenrollment jobs must use the same alias (i.e. "HTTPS") and "Overwrite" must be set to *true*
